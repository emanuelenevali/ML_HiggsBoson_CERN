# Machine Learning - Group Project #1

- Firstly, we present our [implementation](implementation/implementation.py) of some methods extremely useful in the ML fields:

    1. `mean squared error gd(y, tx, initial w, max iters, gamma)`
    2. `mean squared error sgd(y, tx, initial w, max iters, gamma)`
    3. `least squares(y, tx)`
    4. `ridge regression(y, tx, lambda )`
    5. `logistic regression(y, tx, initial w, max iters, gamma)`
    6. `reg logistic regression(y, tx, lambda, initial w, max iters, gamma)`

- Then we faced a ML competition hosted by the [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/) platform, based on the [dataset](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/328) from CERN on the Higgs Boson.

> Our team is called MLE, which is both an acronym of our names (Matteo, Leonardo, Emanuele)and a tribute to the [Maximum-likelihood estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation) :grin:
